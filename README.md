# Redux Meetup Planner

## Project Description

You will build a responsive web application that allows the user to establish a meet-up event. The goal is to create an app that is a joy to use on both desktop and mobile. The application must allow someone to name their event, search for a host location (using a location API like Foursquare), set the capacity of the event, the start and end times, and input a description of the event.


## Tools of the Trade
We will use this project as a template to situate the below technologies within our daily React hustle. The goal is to get productive with building apps in React and  identify a repertoire of tools and ideas that will serve to cultivate a healthy relationship with we call as – *building the web*.

### [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
Quickly bootstrap a react redux app

### [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
Routing to bookmark and navigate across key interaction points in the app

### [React Form](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-form)
Forms as React components introduce boilerplate. This provides a good enough abstraction for this simple project without making it more complicated like [Redux Form](https://github.com/erikras/redux-form)

### [React Virtualised Select](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized-select)
Better management of fetching `options` for `<Select>` field on the fly. And support an infinite list of options without making the DOM sweat. This will indeed shine in this project as we there can be a large number of results returned by Google Places API.

### [React Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/react-storybook)
Showcase individual components with their various possible states. This helps document the app as well as figure and prevent inconsistent state for a component.

### [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js)
Dabble a little in the world of SSR

### [Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
Your React Thug Life™ would be boring wihout a brawl with the likes of CSS-in-JS, inline CSS, et cetra.
